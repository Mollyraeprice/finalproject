### Selected topic:

Can we predict the housing price in the Austin area based on a number of factors?

### Reason they selected the topic:

As Austin based residents, we are curious to see if we can find any trends in our data that will help predict housing prices here in our city. We are looking forward to using this project as a chance to showcase our newly learned analytics styles. Along with the explanation of our data analysis, we will deliver a few visualizations to help tell our story.

### Description of the source of data

After searching for data on  current housing prices in the Austin area, we found a thorough and relatively clean set on Kaggle. A web scraper was used on Zillow to create this dataset. With four years of data and over 700 columns in the original dataset, we have the following information readily available:

- Identifiers: zillow id, address, zip codes
- Pricing: latest price, latest sale date
- Unique Factors: average school distance, average school rating

### Data Focus

#### Average School Distance ?? 

#### Average School Rating ??
